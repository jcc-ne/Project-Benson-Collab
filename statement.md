### Project 1: Benson 

## Motivation
_[From the Tiger 2015 Discretionary Grant Program](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/TIGER%202015%20Innovation%20Project%20Fact%20Sheets.pdf)_:
> Innovation that Creates Efficiencies
> More and more, the transportation sector is relying on data to drive decisions and technology to reimagine how we move people and goods. Increasing mobility and throughput by leveraging investments that enhance data-sharing, signalization and other ITS deployment will change the game for cities, states, public authorities and regions struggling to stretch important dollars to maintain and operate the existing system. The 2016 TIGER grants supported a number of ITS projects. 

Transportation is optimized when commutes are faster, better equipped for volume, and most importantly shorter. Developers and governments know this. Bus services to high-traffic areas reduce congestion, increasing influx of people into cities, and thus commerce. Meanwhile, real estate developers and businesses alike (due to a required commuter benefit](http://www.transitchek.com/transitchek-commuter) win when )they provide spaces for businesses that allow for shorter commutes. 

## Concept
*Distributions* are cooler than numbers. By comparing relative influx and outflux during mornings and evenings, we can show to what degree an area is commuted from or commuted to. Assuming that overall traffic patterns resemble subway traffic patterns, we can provide value to governments seeking to reduce congestion or developers looking to pick sites. 

## Methodology
The premise is that in the mornings, stations with people entering in larger volumes are residential, with people commuting away to work. In the evenings, the results should be opposite.

We plan to consider data from the rush hour periods (2-10am and 2-10pm) only, and then to create heat maps showing the areas of highest differential, we create a resource which can be compared with current public transit allocations or development prospects to identify discrepencies and opportunities for improvement.

## Bottom Line
To NYC, this means a potential for more commerce.
To companies pursuing contracts, this means better leverage to win government grants. Note that last year, NYC rejected 100% of American Reinvestment and Recovery Act Fund proposals related to transit and received in the first half of the year.
To developers, this means better success rate.
